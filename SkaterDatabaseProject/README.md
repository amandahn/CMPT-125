CMPT 125 Assignment 5
=====================

Amanda Ngo, March 2021

Limitations
-----------

The database.txt only includes medals earned since 2010 and no previous medals,
so not all of a skaters medals are counted. For example, Mao Asada won the 
World Championships in 2008, but this is not included in her total number of 
medals. 

Skaters with special characters/accents in their names have these characters 
absent for simplicities sake.

As there are only two disciplines in the database, I implemented a sort by
discipline function instead of sorting the disciplines alphabetically. 

Known Bugs
----------

Extra Features
--------------

Menu has an option to display skaters by country/discipline and
delete skaters by country/discipline.

Information about medalists was taken from here:
